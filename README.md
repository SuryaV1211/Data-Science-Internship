# Data-Science-Internship

This repository contains two projects:
  1. Titanic Survival Prediction - which takes different inputs about a passenger and predicts whether that passager survived or       not.
     (Files required - Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb || trainTSP.csv )
     
  2. Dogs vs Cats - trains on a large dataset of multiple images of cats and dogs, which is taken from kaggle. Instead of              manually downloading the whole dataset, we link the dataset to our program. Afterwhich, we input a image for the program
      predict if the given image is a cat or a dog.
     (Files required - Dogs_vs_Cats.ipynb || kaggle.json || cat.jpg )
